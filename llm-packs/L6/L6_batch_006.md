# L6 operator_shift_log - batch 006 (20 items)

## How to use
1. Start a NEW chat with your LLM and paste this ENTIRE file as the message.
2. It must reply with ONE JSON array only: exactly 20 objects, no prose, no markdown fences.
3. Save the reply as `llm-packs/L6/replies/L6_batch_006.json` (any *.json / *.md / *.txt name inside `replies/` works).
4. Import everything with: `cd backend && uv run mantle-data llm import ../llm-packs`

Items in this file: L6-00100 .. L6-00119 (each has an `item_id` you must echo).

## System prompt (applies to every item)
You are generating realistic but entirely fictional operational records for Baghewala, a heavy-oil field in the Bikaner-Nagaur basin, Rajasthan, India, operated by Oil India Limited. Reservoir: Jodhpur Sandstone, 1,080-1,160 m, 17-19 API crude, asphaltene 7-12 wt%, reservoir temperature 46-48 C, low reservoir pressure (~3 MPa). Wells are produced by cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and conventional beam pumping units with sucker-rod pumps on VFDs. Use Indian field conventions (IST timestamps, INR, metric units with oilfield units in brackets where operators would use them), plausible names for roles (not real people), and terse operator language. Never invent company names other than Oil India Limited and generic vendors ("VFD vendor", "rod supplier"). Output only JSON matching the schema.

## JSON schema for ONE record
